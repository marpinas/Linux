Purpose and Scope
This document provides an overview of the marpinas/Linux repository, a minimal educational collection designed to demonstrate Linux system concepts through interactive scripting. The repository contains a single Bash script that implements a PID (Process ID) guessing game, serving as a practical introduction to Linux process management fundamentals.

This overview covers the repository's structure, main components, and educational objectives. For detailed technical implementation of the script, see PID Guessing Game Script. For comprehensive information about the Linux process concepts demonstrated, see Linux Process Concepts.

Repository Structure
The repository follows a simple, single-file architecture designed for educational clarity:

Script Components

script_adivinar_pid.sh

Variables: NUM, CONT, $$

while [ $NUM -ne $$ ]

read -p commands

echo statements

Core Components
The repository's functionality centers around a single interactive Bash script that demonstrates Linux process concepts:

Component	File	Purpose	Key Elements
PID Guessing Game	script_adivinar_pid.sh	Interactive educational tool	$$, NUM, CONT, while loop
Main Script Architecture
User Input

#!/bin/bash

echo introduction

read -p NUM

CONT=1

while [ $NUM -ne $$ ]

if [ $NUM -gt $$ ]

echo NUM MAYOR

echo NUM MENOR

read -p otro número

CONT=$(($CONT-1))

echo intentos y PID

Educational Framework
The repository demonstrates several fundamental Linux and Bash concepts through practical application:

Linux System Concepts
Process Identification: Uses the $$ built-in variable to access the script's own PID
Process Management: Demonstrates how processes are uniquely identified in Linux systems
Shell Integration: Shows interaction between user space and kernel process information
Bash Scripting Concepts
Interactive Input: Implements read -p for user interaction
Control Structures: Uses while loops and if-else conditionals
Variable Management: Demonstrates variable assignment and arithmetic operations
Built-in Variables: Leverages the $$ system variable for process identification
Code Entity Mapping

Key Technical Features
Variable Usage
NUM: Stores user input from read -p commands 
script_adivinar_pid.sh
4
CONT: Tracks attempt count, initialized to 1 
script_adivinar_pid.sh
6
$$: Built-in Bash variable containing the script's process ID 
script_adivinar_pid.sh
8
Control Logic
Primary game loop: while [ $NUM -ne $$ ] 
script_adivinar_pid.sh
8
Comparison logic: if [ $NUM -gt $$ ] for feedback generation 
script_adivinar_pid.sh
9
Counter arithmetic: CONT=$(($CONT-1)) for attempt tracking 
script_adivinar_pid.sh
