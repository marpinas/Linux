Purpose and Scope
This document provides an overview of the marpinas/Linux repository, a minimal educational collection designed to demonstrate Linux system concepts through interactive scripting. The repository contains a single Bash script that implements a PID (Process ID) guessing game, serving as a practical introduction to Linux process management fundamentals.

This overview covers the repository's structure, main components, and educational objectives. For detailed technical implementation of the script, see PID Guessing Game Script. For comprehensive information about the Linux process concepts demonstrated, see Linux Process Concepts.
